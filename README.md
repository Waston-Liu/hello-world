# hello-world
My first repository

Hi everyone! Waston here, I am just a newbie. I think I preper C, C++ and Python, and every effect will be made in the future.
Oh! My english will be promoted too. Maybe I won't sign in here, because of the courses I have to attend in my daily life, but I still like GitHub which is cool in my opinion.
Thanks for helping a new guy here. I am really appreciated.
